# Olympic Data Analyzer with Streamlit

Welcome to the Olympic Data Analyzer with Streamlit! This is an engaging and user-friendly web application designed to help you explore the rich history of the Summer and Winter Olympics. With this app, you can dive into Olympic data, visualize medal counts, and gain valuable insights into athlete statistics and the performance of countries and athletes over different Olympic seasons. Whether you're a sports enthusiast, data analyst, or just curious about Olympic history, this app offers an accessible and interactive way to unlock the stories hidden within the numbers of the world's most celebrated sporting events.

Unified and Successor Nations: In the case of a unified nation that has emerged from the dissolution of a larger entity (e.g., the Soviet Union), medals won by athletes from the predecessor entities are typically included in the medal count of the unified or successor nation. For example, medals won by Soviet athletes are included in the count for Russia.

Name Changes: If a country undergoes a name change but maintains its continuity as a nation (e.g., when a country changes its official name), the medals are generally included under the new name.

Historical Context: The historical context of the changes matters. If an NOC or country has undergone significant changes, especially in terms of political structure, territory, or identity, it can influence how medals are counted.

International Recognition: Medal counts are often based on international recognition of the nation or NOC by the IOC at the time of the Games. If the IOC recognizes a specific NOC as representing a country, the medals won by athletes from that NOC are typically attributed to that country, even if the political or territorial situation changes later.

Consistency: The IOC strives to maintain consistency in how it handles these situations, and its policies may evolve over time.
